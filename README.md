# MTC Blockchain App in a Day, Microsoft Technology Center
The Blockchain App in a Day is an instructor-led workshop delivered through Microsoft Technology Centers. In the Azure Blockchain GitHub repository, there are many examples of applications that can be directly deployed in a self-led exercise.  This workshop is a full-day event with much deeper context and hands-on reviews of the Microsoft blockchain strategy while specifically focusing on deploying Azure Blockchain Workbench for solution development.

Blockchain (aka, distributed ledger technologies) is disrupting how industries are solving business problems and creating new markets for products and services. In this workshop, the attendee will deploy Azure Blockchain Workbench, deploy initial applications, and develop a blockchain solution for a pre-defined business use case.  
  
## Target Audience

This workshop is not an advanced blockchain development workshop; rather, it’s a hands-on introduction focused on developing a blockchain solution and the process for creating blockchain applications.
 
 ## Objectives
 
 <ul>
  <li> Setup local development and test environments </li>
  <li> Setup Azure environment for hosting the solution </li>
  <li> Review a completed solution and its architecture </li>
  <li> Break down a pre-defined, business use case into the MVP </li>
  <li> Develop a pre-defined, Minimally Viable Product (MVP) using blockchain technologies </li>
  <li> Deploy the completed MVP to Azure </li>
